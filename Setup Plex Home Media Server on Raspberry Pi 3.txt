			For the gid	
				pi@raspberrypi:~ $ id -g pi
					1000
				pi@raspberrypi:~ $
			For the uid	
				pi@raspberrypi:~ $ id -u pi
					1000
				pi@raspberrypi:~ $

					comment=Raspberry Pi Share
					path=/media/usb1
					browseable=Yes
					writeable=Yes
					only guest=no
					create mask=0777
					directory mask=0777
					public=no
